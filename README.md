* **Project Description**The goal of this project is to create a website that makes it easy for CU students to sell their textbooks to other students at CU. Lots of CU students get ripped-off when selling back their textbooks to the bookstore, or bookstores online. Not only that, but a big majority of course books are custom editions which typically aren’t bought-back by anyone. CU students are always on campus so exchanging books for cash on campus is ideal. To encourage use, the big push for this will be making it as easy as possible to buy and sell textbooks on this platform because lets face it, we’re lazy.
