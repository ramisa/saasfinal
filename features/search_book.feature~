Feature: display movies from search
 
	As a user
	In order to find the book I am searching for
	I would like to be able to search for teh book by entering in an ISBN, course code, title or 		author into a search bar. 

Background: books are in the database

  Given the following books exist:
  | title                   | Author | condition    |
  | Saasbook                |        | very good    |

  
Scenario: search for Saasbook
	Given I am on the RalphsList home page
	Then I should see "Search for a book"
	When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Saasbook"
	And I press "Search"
	Then I should be on the RottenPotatoes home page
	And I should see " 'Movie That Does Not Exist' was not found in TMDb."
  
Scenario: Try to find nonexistent book (sad path)
	Given I am on the RalphsList home page
	Then I should see "Search for a book"
	When I fill in "Search Terms" with "Book That Does Not Exist"
	And I press "Search"
	Then I should be on the RalphsList home page
	And I should see " 'Book That Does Not Exist' was not found."
